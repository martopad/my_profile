Profile:
  A hodgepodge between a Developer and a DevOps.

Experience:
  - Employer: Nokia
    Place: Wroclaw, Poland
    Positions:
      - Title: Software Engineer
        Date: Feb 2021 - Present
        Details:
          - Performs DevOps-related tasks that affect multiple teams, ensuring CI/CD pipelines work for all teams.
          - Implement, and push left-shift practices and tooling to all developer teams.
          - Provide DevOps support for the whole BOAM product build-release process. This can range from machine-side issues and environment issues to domain-side code problems.
          - Develop tools to assist in building, running, and performing quality analysis of codebases.

  - Employer: Nokia
    Place: Philippines
    Positions:
      - Title: Research and Development Engineer
        Date: Mar 2019 - Jan 2020
        Details:
          - Performed feature development and maintenance of the WCDMA-OAM project. Handled tester and customer prontos and features. In addition, improvements that involved build-system and CI/CD.
          - Solo-implemented a long-overdue migration to conform with the central build team's unified toolchain/SDK.
            This brought the much-needed platform update that resulted in better compiler and tools, environment consistency,
            and conformance with how the central build team does it. The implementation spanned WCDMA-OAM's monolithic repository
            that housed ~15+ domains previously developed by many teams. In addition, I also performed a wide-sweeping cleanup
            of this monolithic repository, resulting in ~800 files removed in the main branch. 
          - Due to the previous achievement, I was able to push for these various improvements
            Upgrade from c++11 to c++14 standard.
            Research and implement proof-of-concepts for distcc and ccache to accelerate build times. In addition,
            accelerate link times via LLVM linker (ldd).
          - Without any prior training, I delved into DevOps-related work that led to the two previous achievements that extended
            to improvements on the CI side of things. The team had no locally available CI expert at that time, and I was able to implement changes
            Improve visibility of which UT/MT are flaky and uncover a technical debt wherein return code in CI runs are
            determined by console log parsing instead of detecting the return code.
            Adjust each of the ~15+ domains CI configuration to have tighter timeouts (reversed-engineered the legacy solution as
            the configuration didn't reside on the CI itself)

  - Employer: Okada Manila
    Place: Philippines
    Positions:
      - Title: Project Management Intern
        Date: Oct 2016 - Dec 2016
        Details:
          - Worked on projects focused on IBM Maximo, an enterprise asset management system.

Projects:
  - Title: "Hosting my first app on my Kubernetes cluster"
    Subtitle: This CV site is hosted on it!
    Date: 2024
    Details:
      - I hosted a simple static website to ensure that all of my toilings resulted in something fruitful.
        This is exposed to the internet using Cloudflare tunnel.
        Once set correctly, Kubernete's declarative nature is magical; It keeps tripping my danger senses. XD.
        My core Kubernetes setup comprises flannel as CNI, CoreDNS, Istio as ingress controller, and Metallb as load-balancer.
        For the app, I used Cloudflare Tunnels to handle the endpoint and stored the static website content in my
        Glusterfs storage; nginx mounts this to serve the static website. This static website uses Hugo as the website generator.

  - Title: "Creating my own baremetal Kubernetes cluster"
    Subtitle: Kubernetes-the-hardway to boot!
    Date: 2024
    Details:
      - I provisioned my own Kubernetes cluster the hard way! In addition, I used GlusterFS
        as a storage backend. It taught me the parts of a Kubernetes cluster and why Kubernetes
        is a big topic. I also learned Ansible to automate the provisioning and keep the setup
        documented. Learning Glusterfs is also fun. It is surprisingly easy to configure.
        I also created my first, though simple, EBuild to solve a missing package for arm64.

  - Title: "Provisioning my baremetal machines with Gentoo"
    Subtitle: Gentoo on low powered machines, are you insane?
    Date: 2024
    Details:
      - To solve my infrastructure and Linux troubleshooting weakness,
        I bought some Un100ds (x86-64) and Raspberry Pi 5s (arm64) and provisioned
        them with a Linux OS of my choice-- Gentoo.
        It's a challenge to my Linux administration chops(not everything went smoothly.)
        Coincidentally, it challenged my software design skills since I had to make my
        provisioning scripts maintainable (at least to me.)"
