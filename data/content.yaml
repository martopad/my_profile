Profile: A hodgepodge between a Developer and a DevOps

Experience:
  - Employer: Nokia
    Place: Wroclaw, Poland
    Positions:
      - Title: Software Engineer
        Date: Feb 2021 - Present
        Details:
          - Performs DevOps-related tasks that affect multiple teams, ensuring CI/CD pipelines work for all teams.
          - Implement, and push left-shift practices and tooling to all developer teams.
          - Provide DevOps support for the whole BOAM product build-release process. This can range from machine-side issues and environment issues to domain-side code problems.
          - Develop tools to assist in building, running, and performing quality analysis of codebases.

  - Employer: Nokia
    Place: Philippines
    Positions:
      - Title: Research and Development Engineer
        Date: Mar 2019 - Jan 2020
        Details:
          - Performed feature development and maintenance of the WCDMA-OAM project. Handled tester and customer prontos and features. In addition, improvements that involved build-system and CI/CD.
          - Solo-implemented a long-overdue migration to conform with the central build team's unified toolchain/SDK.
            This brought the much-needed platform update that resulted in better compiler and tools, environment consistency,
            and conformance with how the central build team does it. The implementation spanned WCDMA-OAM's monolithic repository
            that housed ~15+ domains previously developed by many teams. In addition, I also performed a wide-sweeping cleanup
            of this monolithic repository, resulting in ~800 files removed in the main branch. 
          - Due to the previous achievement, I was able to push for these various improvements
            Upgrade from c++11 to c++14 standard.
            Research and implement proof-of-concepts for distcc and ccache to accelerate build times. In addition,
            accelerate link times via LLVM linker (ldd).
          - Without any prior training, I delved into DevOps-related work that led to the two previous achievements that extended
            to improvements on the CI side of things. The team had no locally available CI expert at that time, and I was able to implement changes
            Improve visibility of which UT/MT are flaky and uncover a technical debt wherein return code in CI runs are
            determined by console log parsing instead of detecting the return code.
            Adjust each of the ~15+ domains CI configuration to have tighter timeouts (reversed-engineered the legacy solution as
            the configuration didn't reside on the CI itself)

    Positions:
      - Title: Project Management Intern
        Date: Oct 2016 - Dec 2016
        Details:
          - Worked on projects focused on IBM Maximo, an enterprise asset management system.

Projects:
  - Title: "Hosting my first app on my Kubernetes cluster"
    Subtitle: Publicly available
    Date: 2024
    Details:
      - To make sure that all of my toiling resulted in something fruitful, I hosted a simple static website.
        This is exposed to the internet using Cloudflare tunnel. Once setup properly,
        Kubernetes declarative nature is magical, It keeps tripping my danger senses though XD.
        The core kubernetes is composed of flannel as cni, coredns, istio as ingress controller,
        and metallb as load balancer. For the app I deployed cloudflared to handle the endpoint,
        stored the static website content in my glusterfs storage, nginx mounts this to serve the
        static website, the static website is generated using Hugo.

  - Title: "Creating my own baremetal Kubernetes cluster"
    Subtitle: Kubernetes-the-hardway to boot!
    Date: 2024
    Details:
      - As if Gentoo was not hard enough, I provisioned my own Kubernetes
        cluster the hard way! In addition, glusterFS as storage backend.
        It taught me the parts of a kubernetes cluster and why Kubernetes is a big topic.
        I learned also Ansible to automate the provisioning and keep the setup documented.
        Learning glusterfs is also fun. Suprisingly easy to configure.
        Created also my first, though simple, EBuild to solve a missing package for arm64.

  - Title: "Provisioning my baremetal machines with Gentoo"
    Subtitle: Gentoo on low powered machines, are you insane?
    Date: 2024
    Details:
      - To solve my infrastructure and linux troublshooting weakness,
        I bought some un100ds (x86-64) and raspberry pi 5s (arm64) and
        provision then with a linux OS of my choice-- Gentoo.
        Its a challenge to my linux administration chops(not everything went smoothly.)
        Coincedentally, it challenged my software design skills since I have to make my
        provisioning scripts maintainable (at least to me.)"
